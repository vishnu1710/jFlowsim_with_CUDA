# jFlowsim_with_CUDA
jflowsim which was previously thread parallel in CPU mode. I extended this process in GPU (as part of my student job at TU Braunschweig) with JCUDA libraries from http://www.jcuda.de/. 
Now the interactive simualtion is almost 10 times faster with 1GPU of 256 cuda cores compared to 16 threads from CPU.
